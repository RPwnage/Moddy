# About the source

i didnt include the modpacks in the given source code due their size. just download the release version from the link above, and you will have the modpacks needed.

# warning

I've tried to make a system which prevents you from installing multiple mods over each other, and it should work fine, but you should uninstall all mods everytime before you install a new one.

# support
this only works with sxos right now. i will add atmosphere support later.

# how to install moddy

put the moddy folder into the switch folder on your sdcard so it should be structured like this

/switch/moddy/moddy.nro
/switch/moddy/zeldaskinpack/...
/switch/moddy/waluigi_skinpack/...

etc
