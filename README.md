# About the source

I didn't include the modpacks in the given source code due to their size. Just download the release version from the link above, and you will have the modpacks needed.

# Warning

I've tried to make a system which prevents you from installing multiple mods over each other, and it should work fine, but you should uninstall all mods everytime before you install a new one.

# Support
This only works with SX OS right now. I will add Atmosphere support later.

# How to install Moddy

Put the Moddy folder into the switch folder on your sdcard so it should be structured like this

/switch/moddy/moddy.nro
/switch/moddy/zeldaskinpack/...
/switch/moddy/waluigi_skinpack/...

etc
