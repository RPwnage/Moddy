Nintendo Switch BOTW mod installer

If you want a ready to go version, you just have to unzip one of the [Prebuild Releases](https://github.com/iSn0we/Moddy/releases) to your MicroSdCard

## About the source

I didn't include the modpacks in the given source code due to their size. Just download the release version from the link above, and you will have the modpacks needed.

## Warning

I've tried to make a system which prevents you from installing multiple mods over each other, and it should work fine, but you should uninstall all mods everytime before you install a new one.

## Support
This only works with SX OS right now. I will add Atmosphere support later.

## How to install Moddy

Put the Moddy folder into the switch folder on your sdcard so it should be structured like this
extract the prebuilt sdfiles release like this onto your microsdcard.
```
